# windows-terminal-in-context-menu

Nice and easy batch script to open Command line in Windows Terminal on the current location via the right-click context menu.

The script needs to be run as administrator in order to work properly.

![Mouse cursor hovers over the folder containing this project. On right-clicking, the context menu appears and the option "Open Windows Terminal here" is selected. The Windows Terminal instance in the background is split into a new pane, and a Command Prompt with the project directory appears.](/images/ContextMenuDemo.gif)
